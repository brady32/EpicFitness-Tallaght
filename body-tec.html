			<h2 class="white">Body-Tec</h2>
				<p>Body-Tec is one of our most popular classes here in EpicFitness Tallaght. We started this class in March 2014 and still have it to this day. Each session lasts about 20 minutes but don't think you're getting away that easy! Body-Tec is electric muscle stimulation which means you get shocked while doing your workout. This session is for 2 people at a time. The shock intensity is controlled by the trainer. This class comprises of the clients wearing body suits and straps for your legs, arms and bum. During your workout your whole body is being put to work. The electric pulses are working your body contracting the muscles 16 times more than normal along with the physical workout that you are doing at the time. This is a short but intense workout.</p>
