		<h2 class="white">What We Are</h2>
		<p>We are located at Unit 3c & 3d Killinarden Enterprise Park, Tallaght, Dublin 24. We started off as small business in a school doing bootcamps and then introduced different classes such as Trx. There was a strong clientele for this. After a few years we got a small studio and introduced Body-Tec classes. With the demand for the Body-Tec we transitioned into a much bigger studio where we are located now. We hold multiple classes six days a week. Some include Body-Tec, Fitness Classes and Personal Training. You can learn more about these classes in the sections above. Every training session focuses on body and mind. We don't judge anyone here. Our age groups are from people in their 20's up to people in their 50's. Everyone works at their own pace but we do encourage them to push themselves and we also push them to a certain extent of their own abilities.</p>
		<p>Our trainers teach a mixture of different classes and implement different training methods into each class, so every training session is something different. Our trainers all hold fitness certificates and are 100% passionate about their jobs. Our trainers have a combined 23 year's experience which they all share with each other. Our trainer's motivate clients by setting realistic goals and providing feedback to clients.</p> 
		<p>"It is not about achieving an un-realistic goal but to achieve many realistic goals to achieve your final goal!" - John Fylnn</p>

		<h2 class="white">Testimonials</h2>
		<p>I have been part of the EpicFitness Tallaght Team for about 2 years now. My original goal was to lose weight, tone up and improve my stamina. Part of my workout routine includes controlling the foods I eat. I am not limited in the kinds of food I can eat but to consider the calorie intake of what I eat. Motivation and concentration are also a key component’s in helping me reach my goal. Sometimes this can become hard both physically and mentally, but I always know I can count on the trainers and friends that I have made over the past few years. The trainer's go above and beyond to make sure you're ok and even answer you back when it is out of hours. I am proud to be part of a wonderful team.<br>- Dean R.</p>
		
		<p>I have been with EpicFitness Tallaght on and off for the past 3 years. When I first joined EpicFitness Tallaght I was there for just under a year and saw some amazing results but due to work and college commitments I had to leave for a period of time. Now I am back with the team since September 2018 and in a short period of 3 months, I have managed to lose a stone (14 pounds) in weight. It has been difficult to juggle work, college and my workout times but I have found a balance for all three. The journey hard at times with a lot of sweat and some injuries (due to pushing myself too much) but it is the strive and commitment that keeps me going to this day. I have seen a huge difference in myself over 3 months in relation to my physical appearance, strength and mental health. I take part in the Body-Tec classes which I find suits me best. I would highly recommend EpicFitness Tallaght as I have been a part of other weight loss organisations and I have never been able to achieve as much as I do with them.<br>
